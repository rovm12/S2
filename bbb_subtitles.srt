1
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:05,440
well

2
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:09,040
hello my name is big buck bunny

3
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:11,840
you might know me from such films as big

4
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:13,519
back bunny

5
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:15,599
for today i've been asked to tell you

6
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:16,560
about 3d

7
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:19,279
mice and how they can make your life

8
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:20,080
easier

9
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:23,279
as a digital artist traditionally the

10
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:24,080
creation of

11
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:26,480
digital three-dimensional content has

12
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:29,599
relied on two-dimensional input devices

13
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:33,040
over time this can result in a sore arm

14
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:35,440
as well as some less than appetizing

15
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:37,600
visuals

16
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:40,480
well fortunately there are better ways

17
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:40,800
of

18
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:44,160
doing this in the real

19
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:47,200
world objects have many dimensions

20
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:49,600
and we interact with our surroundings

21
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:51,600
with two hands

22
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,680
you wouldn't build an apple with just

23
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:56,160
one hand would you

24
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,960
once upon a time we only had access to

25
00:00:58,960 --> 00:00:59,520
simple

26
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:02,719
two-dimensional input devices this meant

27
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:05,280
that replicating natural interactions

28
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:06,640
with computers was

29
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:10,840
difficult a 3d mouse really makes a

30
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:13,680
difference working with a 3d mouse in

31
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:14,640
one hand

32
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,799
and the standard mouse in the other you

33
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:17,759
can access

34
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:21,040
and interact with all three dimensions

35
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:23,680
at the same time and it's more

36
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:26,799
air-cooked air well

37
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:29,840
let's just say it feels good

38
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:34,320
with 3d mouse actions like panning

39
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:37,360
zooming and rotating

40
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:40,640
certainly just make a whole lot of sense

41
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:43,759
indeed interaction between you and your

42
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:44,799
computer

43
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:48,560
has never been so real with more than a

44
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:49,119
million

45
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:52,159
treaty my sold there are a whole lot of

46
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:53,680
people using them

47
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:56,719
from engineers to artists from

48
00:01:56,719 --> 00:01:59,439
architects to geographers

49
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:02,640
even gamers

50
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:08,239
ah i feel like a young bunny again so

51
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:10,800
you see people from all kinds of

52
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,400
backgrounds and industries

53
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,879
are using 3d mice to make their lives

54
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:16,319
easier and more fun

55
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:19,280
i already have mine shouldn't you also

56
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,840
get one

57
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:23,840
soon

58
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:39,120
you
